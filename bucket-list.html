            <h2>My Ultimate Bucket List</h2>
            <p>When I look ahead at what I want to accomplish in my lifetime, my dreams are driven by two completely different but equally demanding passions: pushing my physical limits on the basketball court and sharpening my mind to become a formidable force in the world of technology.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bucket-card">
            <h3>Pro Dunker in the Philippines</h3>
            <p>Basketball is more than just a game in the Philippines; it is a cultural phenomenon. To stand out in a country that breathes basketball is a monumental challenge, but my ultimate athletic goal is to become a recognized professional dunker. This isn't just about jumping high; it’s about the art, the athleticism, and the showmanship.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mastering the Craft:</strong> Dedicating years to rigorous plyometric training, strength conditioning, and biomechanics to maximize my vertical leap. I want to experience the thrill of perfecting gravity-defying moves like windmills, 360s, and between-the-legs dunks.</li>
                <li><strong>Competing on the Big Stage:</strong> Stepping onto the hardwood under the bright lights of national slam dunk competitions (like the PBA All-Star weekend or FIBA 3x3 events) and hearing the roar of the Filipino crowd after executing a flawless dunk.</li>
                <li><strong>Building a Legacy:</strong> Inspiring the next generation of Filipino athletes by proving that with enough discipline and grind, we can defy expectations and soar just as high as anyone else in the world.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="bucket-card">
            <h3>Cybersecurity Professional</h3>
            <p>While my physical goals require me to live above the rim, my professional goals require me to dive deep into the invisible networks that power our modern world. I have my sights set specifically on the high-stakes, fast-paced arena of Cybersecurity in the IT field.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Attaining Elite Certifications:</strong> Earning industry-leading credentials like the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), CompTIA Security+, and eventually the prestigious Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).</li>
                <li><strong>Becoming a Digital Guardian:</strong> Experiencing the adrenaline rush of "Red Teaming" (ethical hacking) and "Blue Teaming" (defending systems). My goal is to work on the frontlines protecting sensitive data and national infrastructure from malicious cybercriminals.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Evolution:</strong> Reaching a level of expertise where I am predicting cyber threats rather than just reacting to them. I hope to eventually mentor aspiring IT students and become a recognized leader in the field.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="bucket-card">
            <h3>The Common Thread: Discipline</h3>
            <p>Though dunking a basketball and securing a network seem worlds apart, they both require the exact same foundation: relentless discipline, quick reflexes, continuous learning, and the resilience to keep trying after you fail. Whether I am breaking down a complex firewall or breaking the laws of gravity on the court, these two lifetime achievements will define my legacy.</p>
