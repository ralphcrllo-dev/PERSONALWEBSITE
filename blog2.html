          <h3>The Struggle</h3>
          <p>I remember the moment I tried and failed at my first dunk attempt. Everything seemed wrong, my vertical jump was nowhere near good enough, I couldn't reach the rim. My body felt heavy, and it seemed like every time I jumped, it was in memory of all the work I had yet to do. Yet I wouldn't give up. "I began taking small steps towards enhancing my vertical jump. I discovered a strength and conditioning coach who designed a regimen of weight lifting, plyometrics, and jump techniques. I sprinted in the uphill park and repeated jump routines until my legs were burning.</p>
          
          <p>The consequences of this lifestyle manifested gradually but severely. My productivity actually decreased despite spending more hours at my desk. I would stare at code for hours without comprehending it, make careless mistakes that required extensive debugging, and struggle to grasp concepts that should have been straightforward. My health suffered too—I caught every cold that went around campus, developed persistent headaches, and experienced constant fatigue that no amount of coffee could remedy. The following issues became my daily reality:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Difficulty concentrating during lectures and unable to retain information effectively</li>
            <li>Increased anxiety and stress levels that made simple tasks feel overwhelming</li>
            <li>Deteriorating relationships with friends and family due to irritability and lack of time</li>
            <li>Declining academic performance despite spending more time studying</li>
            <li>Physical symptoms including frequent headaches, weakened immune system, and digestive problems</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Breakthrough</h3>
          <p>I made dunking my obsession. I tracked my vertical leap with a Vertec jump trainer, celebrated every inch gained, and committed to recovery and a strict diet. I studied videos of David Carlos "Air David," the number one Filipino pro dunker, rewinding his movements until I could almost feel his technique in my own jumps. I wasn't just training my body to jump higher, I was training my mind to believe.</p>

          <p>Then came the breakthrough. One afternoon session, I exploded off the ground with everything I had. For the first time, the ball went over the rim and exploded into the net. The sound was pure adrenaline. My heart was pounding, my hands were shaking, and I knew that this was what I had been working towards. From that point onwards, I worked even harder. Windmills, tomahawks, every dunk was a new task, a new work of art. Every failure taught me timing and every success just made me hungrier. Dunking was no longer an art. Dunking was me.</p>

          <h3>The Learning Lesson</h3>
          <p>I have learned that dunking has taught me more than just how to jump. Dunking has provided me with the opportunities to acquire steadfastness, unyielding willpower, and the capacity for self-confidence. But what began as a complaint about not being able to touch the rim has become an exquisite transformation. Now, when I see the rim it is not just a rim. I can see all of the untiring hours of sweat and toil that have brought me to where I am today; Before my eyes is constant, determined perseverance in which only success will be greeted with success all the time. At last, Dunking has been more than just a dream, it's a living proof that even attempting to do those things one could never succeed in accomplishing turns out, if you do truly strive in order to match those impossible tasks accomplished, to be possible after all. This is just a beginning in my journey to become a pro dunker back in the Philippines.</p>
