            <p>I have spent my teenage years in Quezon City, studying in private schools. I was not alone in school because my cousins and brothers were with me, which made it all the more meaningful. That school became special to me because it was where I met all my friends who completed my teenage years.</p>
            
            <p>I still remember how much we loved to play basketball before the pandemic. We traveled to places just to play basketball. Sometimes, these games caused fights with other groups we encountered. And though there were fights, those moments became special memories.</p>
            
            <p>There was even an instance when our group had an outing. In that outing, some of my friends argued because of teasing. The argument blew into a physical fight. We were mad at each other, but we all went home together. Although misunderstandings occurred, they reconciled before going to our respective houses.</p>
            
            <p>My teenage years were full of laughter, sporty times, and lessons about loyalty. Basketball was not just basketball; it was a way of bonding. Those friendships I built during those years remain valuable to me. My teenage years molded my social life and taught me resilience.</p>
